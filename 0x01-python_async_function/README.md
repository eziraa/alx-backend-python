# Python Async Function

This directory contains projects and exercises related to asynchronous programming in Python. The focus is on understanding and implementing async functions using the `asyncio` library.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of asynchronous programming.
- Learn how to use `async` and `await` keywords.
- Implement asynchronous functions using the `asyncio` library.
- Handle concurrency and parallelism in Python.

## Project Structure

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Introduction to basic async syntax.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Using async comprehensions.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measuring the runtime of async functions.
- `3-tasks.py`: Working with asyncio tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `asyncio` library

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following command:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to execute.
